# ORM
 - ORMs let you easily interact with your database without worrying too much about the underlying syntax (SQL language for eg)

### some reason why we used ORM:

 - 1. Simpler syntax (converts objects to SQL queries under the hood)

 - 2. Abstraction that lets you flip the database you are using. Unified API irrespective of the DB

 - 3. Type safety/Auto completion

 - 4. Automatic migrations

### what is prisma?
 - -> Next generation Node js and TypeScript ORM
prisma unlocks a new level of developer experience when working with databases thanks to its intuitive data model, automated migrations, type-safety & auto-completion.

### install prims in a fresh project.

 - npx prisma init

 - after this you have to migrate the database 

 - npx prisma migrate dev --name Initialize the schema

### How to generate the client?
 - npx prisma generate

// autogenerated client

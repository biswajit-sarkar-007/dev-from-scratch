#the todos we are created is not ready for production level its not good approach


# what id there is a server where these todos are put 
what if you update a TODO from your mobile app, you will get back new arrays of todos on the frontend

How will you update the DOM then ?
You only have a addTodo function , you dont't have and updateTodo or remove Todo function yet.

# if u can write a function , that takes this state as an input and create the output on right , that is much powerful than original approach 

`
{
    {
        id:1,
        title:"Go to gym",
        description:"Go to gym at 7:30pm"
    },
    {
        id:2,
        title:"Go to college",
        description:"Go to college at 9:00am"
    }
}
`

# now we have the state from backend which hold the all tods and a frontend if there would be a libery that's help to runder the js in html it would be nice


# Vartual DOM

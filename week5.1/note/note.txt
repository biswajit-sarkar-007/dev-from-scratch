Jsx,  static vs dynamic websites, State, components, re-rendering, 

#for dynamic websites react liberays help very much for dom manupulation

#three important things in react:
1.components
2.state
3.rendering

#state:
an object that represents the current state of the app,
it represents the dynamic things in your app(things that change) 
For exmaple, the value of the counter

#components:
how a dom element should render, given a state,
it is a re-useable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state

#rendering:
changes the dom element
a re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state change

# after u decleare a state varible react is automatically update the dom according to the state.

#jsx is the js + xml

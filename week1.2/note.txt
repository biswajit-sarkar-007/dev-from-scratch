1.why languages ?              c/c++/java  --> 01010
Ans:   VLC ---> Compiler(convert highlevel language to low level lanaguage) ---> 01010 ---> RAM

[-] write code -> compile code -> Run the code

a.cpp  ->  g++ a.cpp -a temp ->  /temp



-c,c++ is compiler type language
-js  is intrepreted type language, can run partially if the error comes later

# static vs dynamic languages :
c++        |    js 
more strict| can move faster
code       |  


# single threaded nature of js
 
#simple primitive in js
1.variables(let,var,const)
2.datatype(string, bolean,number)
3.if/else
4.loop

#complex primitive
1.array
2.objects 

*array of object:
`const arrOfObj = [{
    firstName: "ram",
    age:21,
    isMarried:true

},{
    firstName: "sam",
    age:17,
    isMarried:false
},
{
    firstName: "sita",
    age:20,
    isMarried:true
}]
`

#function:
1.abstract out logic for your program
2.take argument as an input
3.return value as a output
*4.fn can take other fn as input - this will called (callbacks)
  
#setTimeout
#setInterval

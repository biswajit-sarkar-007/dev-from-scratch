# React returns, re-rendering, key, Wrapper components,
useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, useRef,
Prop Drilling

# A component can only return a single
top level xml
Why?
1. Makes it easy to do reconciliation 


# minimize the re rendering
--> push the state to the down

# You want to minimise the number of re-renders to make a highly optimal react app
The more the components that are getting re-rendered, the worse

# Use React.memo
meme lets u skip re-rendering

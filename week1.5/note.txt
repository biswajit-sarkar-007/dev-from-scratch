# Async function vs sync functions

->i.together, one after the other, sequential  
ii.Only one thing is happeing at a time

->i.opposite of synchronous 
ii.Happens in parts, Multiple things are context switching with each other 


# exmale of some async functions:
setTimeout, fs.read, Fetch

# anonymous fuction 

# promises

1.pending, 2.resolve , 3.reject

promise its just a class that makes callbacks and async functions slightly more readable.

whenhever u crate it , you need to pass in a function as the first argument which has resolve as the First argument

`let p = new Promise(function(resolve){
   resolve("hi there )
});

console.log(p)
`

- promises are basically a wrapper top of the setTimeout()


# async await

# protocol: the way your frontend talk to backend

Things that happen in your browser
after you fire this request
 
1. Browser parses the URL
2. Does a DNS Lookup (converts google.com to an IP)
3. Establishes a connection to the IP (does handshakeâ€¦)
What is DNS resolution
URLs are just like contacts in your phone
In the end, they map to an IP
If you ever buy a URL of your own, you will need to point it
to the IP of your server





In the end, its the client throwing some information at a server
Server doing something with that information
Server responding back with the final result
Think of them as functions, where
1. Arguments are something the client sends
2. Rather than calling a function using its name, the client uses a URL
3. Rather than the function body, the server does something with the request
4. Rather than the function returning a value, the server responds with some data

What are the common methods you can send to your BE server?
1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE

What are the common status codes the backend responds with?
1. 200 - Everything is ok
2. 404 - Page/route not found
3. 403 - Authentication issues
4. 500 - Internal server error
